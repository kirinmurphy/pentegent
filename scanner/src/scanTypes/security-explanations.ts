    remediation: {
      generic: "Add the header: Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains\nOptionally add 'preload' to protect the very first visit, but this is a long-term commitment — see hstspreload.org before opting in.",

    remediation: {
      generic: "Start with: Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self'\nNote: 'unsafe-inline' for styles is sometimes needed for CSS-in-JS frameworks, but weakens CSP.

  },

  "Self-signed certificate": {
    what: "The certificate was signed by the server itself rather than a trusted Certificate Authority.",
    why: "Self-signed certificates are not trusted by browsers, causing security warnings. They also make the site vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks since there is no third-party verification of identity.",

  "Hostname mismatch": {
    what: "The certificate's Subject Alternative Names (SANs) do not include the hostname being accessed.",

  "Weak cipher": {
    what: "The server negotiated a cipher suite that uses known-weak algorithms (RC4, DES, 3DES, EXPORT, NULL, or anonymous key exchange).",
    why: "Weak ciphers can be broken by attackers, allowing them to decrypt intercepted traffic and steal sensitive data.",
    remediation: {
      generic: "Configure your server to use only strong cipher suites. Recommended: ECDHE+AESGCM:ECDHE+CHACHA20:DHE+AESGCM:DHE+CHACHA20",

  "No forward secrecy": {
    what: "The negotiated cipher suite does not support forward secrecy (PFS).",
    why: "Without forward secrecy, if the server's private key is ever compromised, all past encrypted traffic can be decrypted retroactively.",
    remediation: {
      generic: "Configure your server to prefer cipher suites with ECDHE or DHE key exchange, which provide forward secrecy.",

  "Certificate chain incomplete": {
    what: "The server did not provide a complete certificate chain back to a trusted root CA.",
