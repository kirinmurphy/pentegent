  "Potential XSS pattern detected": {
    what: "Inline JavaScript patterns were found that may indicate a cross-site scripting vulnerability or unsafe coding practice.",
    why: "XSS vulnerabilities allow attackers to inject malicious scripts that execute in other users' browsers, potentially stealing sessions, credentials, or performing actions on behalf of the user.",
    remediation: {
      generic: "Sanitize all user input before rendering. Use Content-Security-Policy to block inline scripts. Encode HTML entities in dynamic content.",
